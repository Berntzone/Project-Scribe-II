Welcome to Project Scribe II!

This is a remix of the original [Project Scribe](https://github.com/UrbanCircles/scribe) by Urban Circles. Thank you for the great inspiration for a fun weekend project :)

Main changes:
- Printer drivers are rewritten for the EM5820 thermal printer.
- All serial debug output removed as Scribe II uses HardwareSerial instead of SoftwareSerial.
- Separate file for input of WiFi credentials.

Work in progress:
- Allow use of 'Enter' to make to-do lists without inverting line order.

TODO:
- Upload pictures of final product.
- PINOUT scheme
- Upload STLs for 3D printing
- Write a better description and step-by-step.

Thanks for reading!
Take care
